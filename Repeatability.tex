\subsection{Note 1: Coefficient of Repeatability}
The coefficient of repeatability is a measure of how well a
measurement method agrees with itself over replicate measurements
\citep{BA99}. Once the within-item variability is known, the
computation of the coefficients of repeatability for both methods
is straightforward.
