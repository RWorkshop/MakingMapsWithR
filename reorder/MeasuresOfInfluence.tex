\section{Measures of Influence} %1.16

The impact of an observation on a regression fitting can be determined by the difference between the estimated regression coefficient of a model with all observations and the estimated coefficient when the particular observation is deleted. The measure DFBETA is the studentized value of this difference.

Influence arises at two stages of the LME model. Firstly when $V$ is estimated by $\hat{V}$, and subsequent
estimations of the fixed and random regression coefficients $\beta$ and $u$, given $\hat{V}$.


\subsection{DFFITS} %1.16.1
DFFITS is a statistical measured designed to a show how influential an observation is in a statistical model. It is closely related to the studentized residual.
\begin{displaymath} DFFITS = {\widehat{y_i} -
\widehat{y_{i(k)}} \over s_{(k)} \sqrt{h_{ii}}} \end{displaymath}


\subsection{PRESS} %1.16.2
The prediction residual sum of squares (PRESS) is an value associated with this calculation. When fitting linear models, PRESS can be used as a criterion for model selection, with smaller values indicating better model fits.
\begin{equation}
PRESS = \sum(y-y^{(k)})^2
\end{equation}


\begin{itemize}
\item $e_{-Q} = y_{Q} - x_{Q}\hat{\beta}^{-Q}$
\item $PRESS_{(U)} = y_{i} - x\hat{\beta}_{(U)}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{DFBETA} %1.16.3
\begin{eqnarray}
DFBETA_{a} &=& \hat{\beta} - \hat{\beta}_{(a)} \\
&=& B(Y-Y_{\bar{a}}
\end{eqnarray}
